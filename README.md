# 💫 About Me:
👋 I’m Mohit Mandal, a student who loves exploring technology and learning new things every day.<br><br>💻 I spend most of my time experimenting with web development, building small projects with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and sometimes Python.<br><br>🤔 I don’t claim to be an expert, but I enjoy figuring things out and learning from mistakes.<br><br>🤖 I love exploring AI tools and seeing how they can be applied to real problems.<br><br>🌐 I enjoy creating interactive websites and 3D portfolio experiences where I can test my skills and push myself.<br><br>🚀 I’m interested in startups and tech innovations and often think about how small ideas can grow into something bigger.<br><br>📚 Even though I’m still learning, I try to stay consistent and curious, following tutorials, watching videos, and reading articles to improve.<br><br>🎨 I like combining creativity with coding, adding animations, and making things feel alive.<br><br>🧪 I build small experiments with AI just to see what’s possible and enjoy pushing boundaries.<br><br>🛠️ I spend time thinking about how technology can impact people’s lives and plan small projects or apps that could help others.<br><br>🕵️‍♂️ I enjoy problem-solving, even if it takes hours of trial and error, and I try to stay patient.<br><br>💡 Curiosity motivates me more than recognition, and I like challenging myself with new things in coding or development.<br><br>👀 I follow other developers to see what they build and take inspiration without copying.<br><br>⚙️ I enjoy both front-end and back-end tasks, learning about servers, databases, APIs, and everything in between.<br><br>🐛 Debugging is fun for me, especially when a project finally works after hours of trying.<br><br>🌟 I think a lot about tech trends and the skills that will matter in the future.<br><br>📝 I plan my learning paths but also give myself freedom to explore whatever interests me in coding.<br><br>📖 I like reading documentation to understand frameworks and tools deeply.<br><br>🤝 I enjoy collaborating with friends or peers on small projects, even just for practice.<br><br>🔄 I often make my own versions of things I see online to learn how they work.<br><br>🔗 I mix different technologies together to create unique projects.<br><br>💪 I am driven by curiosity, creativity, and the desire to improve, even if I fail sometimes.<br><br>⏳ I know consistent learning matters more than instant results and enjoy the process.<br><br>🆕 I keep up with new programming languages, frameworks, and AI technologies.<br><br>✨ I love building something from scratch and seeing it come to life.<br><br>📤 I share my projects with others because practice and feedback help me grow.<br><br>🔧 I experiment with web animations, interactivity, AI integration, and practical projects.<br><br>🎯 I focus on learning step by step and staying consistent with small daily efforts.<br><br>❤️ I’m passionate about coding, exploring technology, building, testing, failing, learning, and trying again.<br><br>🔑 I believe curiosity and persistence matter more than perfection.
